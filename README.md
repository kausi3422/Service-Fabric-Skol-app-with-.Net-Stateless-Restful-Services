README NOTES (Service Fabric application with Clean Architecuture implementation)


1) a) As .Net 6 preview SDK's are used to convert this Skol application to a Service Fabric application,
it is recommended to enable Visual Studio to support preview sdk's by going to Tools -> Options 
and then make sure to tick or enable 'Use Previews of the .Net SDK (required restart)'

b) Go to applcation properties of every Class or Console apps of the solution 
and notice how the Target Framework says '.Net 6'. 



2) Also there is this issue of not being able to install for example .Net 6 preview version 
3 & 5 or any other version and use them for development simultaneously. Only one preview 
version of any .Net version is allowed to be installed on a PC. 


(Dont use Mac's to develop SF apps)
